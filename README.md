# Cellulith
An RP2040 based IoT/cellular device. Essentially a cell phone but very bulky.

# Why it's called "Cellulith"
Lith means rock or stone. For example, the Earths crust is called the lithosphere because its a sphere of rock.
Cellu comes from cellular, like cellular phone.
The inspiration for the name was Cellulite, which was proposed by the founder of Oak Dev Tech, however I felt that the "lite" suffix made it sound small.
